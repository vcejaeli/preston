use fname lname on sign up to see changes on about "our users"


## idea
This is a website for a fictitious gym/sports complex facility where people can sign up for memberships. 
The website has a landing, membership, available, amenities, about, contact, and account page. 
The idea is to get members and be able to track them on the website. 
The facility offers many things so there is a toggle to check when an area/amenity is in use.

home:
the home page features a simple intro to the site, highlights the memberships offered and offers the user some options.

membership:
the membership page goes into more detail on what each package gets you and gives the options to chose. the annual plan is clearly the better deal and is highlighted to look that way.

available:
the available page uses some toggle buttons so a person can come into the site and see whats taken/not taken and change it themselves. there is also a section that shows social media posts from users.

amenities:
the amenities page shows off the facilities and the many things that are offered at the complex.

about:
the about page gives visitors a chance to see who some of the staff members are, and what they do. there is another social media section to make it a bit more entertaining. 

contact:
the contact page offers a form and shows a nice teamwork image to go along with it.

account:
the account page is where a user can come and login if they wish.
